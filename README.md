#**Card cancellation analysis using Python**

##The following project receives a csv file, with customer data regarding the use of a company's cards. The aim is to assess, based on the data, whether there is any aspect that indicates why some customers are canceling their cards.

The first information obtained refers to the distribution of customers according to various factors, as shown in the figure below:




From this, the initial number of active customers and those who canceled their cards are revealed, firstly the total values ​​are presented and then converted to a percentage.

##The Graphics

Graphs are generated where active customers are distinguished from customers who have canceled, so it is possible to evaluate the behavior of the curves obtained according to each parameter considered. Below is an example of one of the graphs obtained.





Note: a graph was generated for each column (parameter) of the table. These columns include information such as: number of dependents, age of the client, number of financial transactions, salary range, among others. Following this sequence, approximately 20 graphs were built.

##Conclusion

Analyzing the graphs, it was possible to visualize some behaviors that would generate good insights for the company, such as:

As the customer contacts the company, the greater the chances of him canceling his card.
Mostly, the cards that are canceled are from the Blue line
If the customer is part of more complete card programs, the tendency to cancel is lower.
Those customers who use the card the least, who make few transactions and/or transactions of low financial value, tend to cancel.
